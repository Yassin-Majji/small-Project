This is a simple yet functional e-commerce website that serves as an introduction to building web applications with React.js. The project consists of two main pages:

Home Page: This is the main page of the website. It displays a list of products fetched from a backend server (such as a simple API). Each product is shown with an image, title, and price.

Product Upload Page: This page allows users to upload new products to the server. Users can input details like the product's name, image, and price, and upon submission, the product is added to the server's database.

Features:
Simple and Clean UI: The design of the website is user-friendly, with easy navigation between the pages.
Product Display: Products are displayed dynamically on the homepage, fetched from a server and shown with all relevant information.
Product Upload: Users can easily add new products through a form with fields for the product title, image URL, and price.
Error Handling: Proper error handling has been implemented to ensure a smooth user experience even when something goes wrong (e.g., network issues, server errors).
Backend Integration: The website is connected to a backend API where the products are stored and retrieved, making it a fully functional e-commerce platform at a small scale.
Technologies Used:
React.js: A JavaScript library used to build the user interface with reusable components.
Axios: Used to handle HTTP requests and communicate with the server to fetch and submit data.
CSS: For styling the website and making it visually appealing.
Purpose:
This project was created to demonstrate fundamental concepts in building a web application using React. It also highlights how to integrate a frontend with a backend, handle user input, and display dynamic data on a webpage. It's a great starting point for anyone looking to learn web development and understand how a basic e-commerce website works.
